# SWP-2023-Automatic-Detection-of-Vibratory-Behavior-of-Honeybees

Model for classifying bee behavior based on a stack of video frames.

The evaluations of different model architectures are saved into the `stats_*` directories.
The contents of the `stats_*` directory are generated after training and show the test/training accuracies at each epoch,
mean loss at each epoch and confusion matrix from the trained model.

## TODO

-   [  ] image augmenation (blur, contrast, crop, translation, stretching, padding) (WIP)
-   [ ] pretrain CNN to produce good image embeddings
